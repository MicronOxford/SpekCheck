/*
  The logo is the Heavy check mark character, unicode 10004, with the
  visible spectrum as color.  There's not really a CSS option to use
  an image as color, so we set the font as transparent, while clipping
  the image with the text.  This works in most of current browsers.
  In the ones that do not work, it will falback to use a white font
  over an image of the visible spectrum.

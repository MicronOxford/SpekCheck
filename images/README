* spekcheck-logo.svg

Icon was created in inkscape by merging a checkmark icon and an image
of the visible spectrum.

The checkmark icon is the bold checkmark of wingdings font (252 0xfc
U+00b8 "checkbld" CEDILLA).  It was converted to svg from the ttf file
with font forge.

The image of the visible spectrum was created with the
'create-spectrum.py' script in spekcheck, for the 380-780nm range.

The visible spectrum is an image with a single row and is embedded on
the final svg.  It is was resized to have the same dimensions as the
checkmark icon.  Finally, the merge is done by the set of the two
objects (Object>Clip>Set on inkscape).
